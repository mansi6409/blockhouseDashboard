# Dashboard Chart Application

This project is a dashboard featuring multiple interactive charts including Bar, Line, Pie, and Candlestick charts. The chart data is fetched from a Django backend API and displayed on the frontend using React, Redux, and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v15 or higher)
- **npm** (or Yarn)
- **Python** (v3.7 or higher)
- **Django**

### Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to Backend Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Create and Activate Virtual Environment (Optional)**:
   Itâ€™s recommended to use a virtual environment for the Django application.
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Python Dependencies**:
   Run the following to install all Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ````

4. **Run the Backend Server**:
   Start the Django development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

   The API will be running at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to Frontend Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Run the following command to install the necessary npm packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Frontend**:
   After installing dependencies, you can run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The frontend will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

4. **Tailwind CSS Configuration**:
   Tailwind CSS is used for styling, and it is already configured in `globals.css` and `tailwind.config.js`. The global styles are loaded in the layout component.

## Running the Application

1. **Start the backend API using Django**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
   The API should be accessible at `http://localhost:8000/api/`.

2. **Run the frontend using Next.js**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Navigate to** [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the dashboard and charts.

   ```bash
   Note: If the port is other than 3000, then navigate to backend > config > setting.py and update CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS with the correct port number
   ```

4. **Running Unit tests for Django**: Navigate to backend folder and run:
   ```bash
   python manage.py test
   ```

## Backend API

The Django API serves the data for each chart. Below are the available API endpoints:

- **Bar Chart Data**: `/api/bar-chart-data/`
- **Line Chart Data**: `/api/line-chart-data/`
- **Pie Chart Data**: `/api/pie-chart-data/`
- **Candlestick Chart Data**: `/api/candlestick-data/`

## Libraries and Tools

### Backend:
- **Django**: Used for creating the backend API that provides chart data.
- **Django REST Framework**: To easily create REST APIs.
- **Python**: For the backend logic and API.
- **Django's built-in testing framework**: For running unit tests.

### Frontend:
- **Next.js**: Used as the React framework to create the dashboard.
- **React-Chart.js-2**: For rendering the charts using Chart.js.
- **Chart.js**: Library for building the charts.
- **Redux**: State management for fetching chart data and maintaining the global state.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the frontend components.
- **Axios**: For making API requests from the frontend.

## Approach and Thought Process

The aim is to create the dashboard such that the code structure is clean and organized and making future changes to the code should be easy. This should be possible without refactoring a lot of code. Keeping this in mind, The repository has been divided into 2 main parts - frontend and backend. Both of these parts have their own package.json and requirements.txt respectively for easy setup.

Additionally, the components for frontend have been created as disjoint component so that every component can function on its own without messing up with other components. This helped in easy debugging for every component.


### Backend:
- The Django REST API is structured with different endpoints for each chart's data, ensuring modularity and easy maintainability.
- The chart data is hardcoded in the API for simplicity, but can be dynamically generated or fetched from a database if required.

### Frontend:
- **State Management**: Redux is used to manage global state and make API calls to fetch chart data. This ensures the charts are updated automatically when data changes.
- **Charts**: React-Chart.js-2 is used to display the charts, leveraging Chart.js for chart rendering. Each chart has its own component, making the code modular and maintainable.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS is used to style the frontend, making it responsive and visually appealing.
- **Responsiveness**: The dashboard layout is made responsive using Tailwind CSS, ensuring proper display on different screen sizes.
